UDXS ScreenPort Monochrome Stream Format (SPMS)

SPMS is a simple format for monochrome framebuffer streams.
It's optimized for monochrome UIs, which often use large areas
of a single color or a dithering pattern.
SPMS does scanline-by-scanline compression in a way that's accelerable
in hardware while plenty fast in software.

The first step in encoding to SPMS is to first perform a differential filter.
In essence, only the first pixel in a sequence of repeated color pixels is
illuminated. 
To encode this, the encoder must operate bit by bit, enabling
only bits that are different from the previous bit (called the "existing state").
The initial state of the encoder is implicitly 0 at the start of each scanline
so, if the first pixel on a scanline is 1, the output must be 1.



Hardware Acceleration
Though differential encoding and RLE can be sped up with some amount of
combinational logic, the key mechanism for speeding up encoding is the
use of multiple encoder cores. Each core would perform the task of
differential encoding and then RLE for a different scanline.
On SP for Asterix, for example, 16 encoder cores each compress about scanlines.
Each core is fed a scanline by a FIFO, which in turn is fed by a shift register
accepting serial data from
