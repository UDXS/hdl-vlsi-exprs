# HDL/VLSI Experiments
A collection of Verilog/Innovus experiments.

## ASQRT
Flexible 32-bit square-root implementation. Implemented with Cadence Genus/Innovus and FreePDK45. Lacking formal verification.

## asterix-emu
Simple SPI-to-UART bridge emulating the Sharp LS013B7DH05 MiP display for smartwatch development purposes
with the Asterix RebbleOS platform and the Nordic nRF52840DK. There is a really small serial reader program 
in asterix-emu/viewer.

## aTwo
Simple 8-bit CPU using someone else's ISA. Implemented with Cadence Genus/Innovus and FreePDK45. Lacking any verification.
